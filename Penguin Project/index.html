        <h2>Penguins</h2>
        <p>Penguins are the only birds that can swim but cannot fly. These black and white seabirds move about very easily in the water. On land they stand upright and waddle about.A penguin typically has a black back and a white belly. Different types range in height from about 14–45 inches (36–114 centimeters). The largest type is the emperor penguin, which weighs about 80 pounds (36 kilograms). </br></br>Penguins are excellent swimmers and divers. They can swim faster than 25 miles (40 kilometers) per hour. Penguins use their short, paddlelike wings as flippers for swimming. Their feet are webbed, and their bodies are shaped like torpedoes. Penguins have short legs, but they can run fairly quickly. To travel over ice and snow, a penguin may slide on its belly.</p>
